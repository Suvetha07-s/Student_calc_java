Write-Up: Applying Java Programming Skills to Build a Student Grade Calculator
As part of strengthening my core programming skills, I developed a simple yet effective Java application called the Student Grade Calculator. This project helped me practically apply fundamental Java concepts including input handling, loops, conditional statements, data validation, and basic arithmetic operations.

To begin, I used the Scanner class for user input, allowing dynamic interaction where users could specify how many subjects they want to enter marks for. Implementing loops enabled me to efficiently collect and process multiple inputs without code repetition. I also used if-else conditional logic to validate user inputs, ensuring that marks are within the 0–100 range. If the user entered invalid marks, the program would prompt them again, which improved the user experience and program reliability.

Once all valid marks were collected, I calculated the total and average marks. Then, based on the average, the program assigned a grade from A to F using a clear and logical conditional structure. This section tested my ability to implement and structure decision-making code efficiently.

One key skill I applied was error handling through validation. By preventing incorrect inputs, I ensured that the program runs smoothly and produces accurate results. I also focused on keeping the interface simple and user-friendly, which is an important part of software design.

Through this project, I gained practical experience with Java’s syntax, object-oriented features, and the importance of writing clean, maintainable code. It also gave me confidence in designing and implementing console-based applications. This small project has laid the foundation for building more complex applications involving file handling, GUI design, or database connectivity.

Overall, developing the Student Grade Calculator was a valuable exercise in applying my Java programming skills in a real-world use case.
